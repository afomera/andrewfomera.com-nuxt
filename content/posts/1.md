Hello everyone!

I've spent the last few weekends working on my new website. It's complete with a blog for me to forget to post to and a Projects section where I can showcase my latest work to the internet. 

I can even do cool stuff like the following...

```ruby
def hello_world
   puts "hello world!"
end
```

Isn't that syntax highlighting cool? I think it is pretty cool. Hopefully this blog will go longer than the last time I started a blog. If you have something interesting to talk to me about, click the contact form and shoot me an email. (That's also new) 

I plan on blogging about development related things and maybe sprinkle a few updates on how my daily workouts are going.

I did a technical writeup on my first real project called [Photogram](http://andrewfomera.com/projects/photogram). Give it a read and let me know what you think!

Hope to talk to you soon
Andrew
