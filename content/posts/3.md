Hey everyone!

I have officially released my first of what I hope is to be many more RubyGems. It's called Fancy Notifications and it aids in allowing you to create good looking flash messages in your Ruby on Rails applications.

I am guilty of using Bootstrap far more than what I would like to, simply because a bunch of the design work is done for me and I can focus on the bulk of it... so when I saw that [Mackenize Child at Unicasts](http://unicasts.com) made a video on creating ["Fancy Notifications"](https://www.unicasts.com/screencasts/fancy-notifications) I fell in love with what he did. I wanted to add them to ALL of my applications... and it got me thinking that there had to be a better way to stop duplicating the code.

So I decided, let's extract out the code I learned/used from Mackenize and put it into a Gem to make it easy to use in future projects.

I will add more "notice types" and customization options for more flash notifications soon, but for now it's reasonably functional. You can find installation/usage instructions on the [README](https://github.com/king601/fancynotifications/blob/master/README.md)

You can find the Gem on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/fancynotifications). You can view the [source code](https://github.com/king601/fancynotifications/) as well.

If you have any suggestions, hit me up on Twitter: [@AndrewFomera](http://twitter.com/AndrewFomera), or the [GitHub](https://github.com/king601/fancynotifications/) repo.
