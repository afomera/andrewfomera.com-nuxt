Welcome back!

So over the weekend I have spent some time working on a refresh of the site. I have some more work to do on the home page and a few miscellaneous changes on other pages, but I felt it was close enough to done to push live and get some real testing done.

Edit: I've updated the homepage on the site and it looks much better than it did before!

I added responsive navigation to the site, which to many people won't mean much, but it means that the site will look way better when you are browsing on your phone. This was a big learning experience/mission for me. I had never made it responsive myself before now so this was something that taught me far more than I expected.

I like the nice, clean look I have going here and I'm looking forward to seeing what the future holds for my site. I'm open to feedback and suggestions, so if you've got some hit me up.

As always if you want to get in touch with me hit the [contact link](http://andrewfomera.com/contact/new) and send me an email! I'd love to work together on things or just chat more!

Hope you have an amazing day!
