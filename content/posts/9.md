Hello everyone!

Today I'm writing to let everyone know I launched a new web app. This one is called [tmsg.io](http://tmsg.io) and it was created to make messaging groups of people easier.

For example, lets say you have a group of people you need to send messages to but don't need a response from. Let's say a reminder that you're throwing a party on Saturday evening. So you add your friends to a Group of party goers and then you can schedule a message to be sent to them.  Or if you want to send a message to a group of people just once you can do that too with it.

## Check out [tmsg.io](http://tmsg.io)

Just a heads up, if you're going to use **[tmsg.io](http://tmsg.io)**, you'll get 200 messages to send with it before you hit a quota limit. I envision this as more of a proof of concept thing, if you like or need this kind of a service in your life, contact me and let's talk about how I can customize this to fit your needs better.

I spent around three months working on it off and on and this past week I got serious about getting it finished and decided to launch it.  So consider tmsg.io in beta, which means there could be things that don't make sense, but will get better.

To get the most use out of the site you can add it to your iPhone's home screen and it'll act just like an app you downloaded from the App Store.

## If you sign up and use tmsg please let me know, I'd love to hear your suggestions or feedback.

Thanks for reading everyone. If you have thoughts on this, hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AndrewFomera)
