              When I was growing up, I wanted to build things.
              It started when I was young and I found two old computers in my basement and much to my parents shock,
              I took them apart and started trying to put them back together. Ever since then, I've been on an adventure to build things.
              Getting into Software Engineering in 2016 (professionally), I have been working to grow every day.
