            AthensMC is an online gaming community focused around providing a safe place to play games online.
            I started AthensMC in 2014 when I was trying to learn Ruby on Rails and
            it's grown into a decently sized application with a variety of features all around building the community.

          <h5 class="card-title">Hootstrap</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Hootstrap is ProctorU's design framework built on top of Bootstrap 4.
          This was an internal project I help maintain now, and we upstream all shared code for projects to use.
          One benefit of Hootstrap is it does not require jQuery for the Javascript components.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>I added support for collapable navbars.</li>
            <li>I upgraded it from Bootstrap 4.0 to Bootstrap 4.1.</li>
